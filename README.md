# Web-Scraping-project
# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project 👩‍💻📊

## Overview of the Project 📑

The project aims to collect real-time COVID-19 data from various reliable sources using web scraping techniques. It involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for data-driven decisions and gaining real-time insights.

### Overview of the Dataset 📊

The dataset used in this analysis contains comprehensive information on COVID-19 data, including Country, Total cases, Total deaths, critical cases, total recovered cases, and more.

## Project Tasks 🚀

1. **Web Scraping**

2. **Data Cleaning (RegEx) 🧹**

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📈**
   - Time Series Analysis
   - Summary Statistics
   - Visualizations
   - Draft meaningful insights

## Insights 💡

1. The strong correlation between `totalcases` and `totaldeaths` suggests that the number of deaths is a good proxy for the severity of the pandemic. This can be used to track the progress of the pandemic and assess the effectiveness of control measures.

2. The moderate correlation between `totalcases` and `totaltests` suggests that increasing the number of tests can help identify more cases and track the spread of the virus. This information can inform public health measures, such as contact tracing and isolation.

3. The weak correlation between `totalcases` and `population` suggests that the size of the population is not a major factor in determining the number of cases. This indicates that control measures should be implemented regardless of the size of the population.

4. The negative correlation between the death rate and the recovery rate suggests that the two variables are competing outcomes. Balancing these outcomes is crucial when developing policies and interventions.
